# SQL Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs exploratory and analytical queries on a sales dataset
to derive business insights related to revenue, products, and customer behavior.

## Project Origin
The dataset structure and initial direction were inspired by a guided SQL course.
All queries, extensions, optimizations, ranking logic, and analytical insights
were independently implemented and expanded by me.

## Dataset
The project uses three CSV files:
- dim_customers.csv
- dim_products.csv
- fact_sales.csv

These files represent a star-schema style data model.

## Analysis Performed
- Dataset and schema exploration
- Sales KPIs (revenue, orders, quantities)
- Product demand analysis
- Customer behavior analysis
- Revenue breakdowns by category and customer
- Ranking using window functions
- Use of temp tables and optimized joins

## Skills & Concepts Used
- SQL Server
- Aggregations & GROUP BY
- Window Functions
- Subqueries
- Temp Tables
- Star Schema Modeling
- Analytical Thinking

## Notes
This repository represents my enhanced version of a course-guided project,
with additional queries, deeper analysis, and optimized SQL patterns.
